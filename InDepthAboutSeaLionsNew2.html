<h2><strong>Sea Lions are typically known to hunt together in packs</strong></h2>
	<p><p style="color:blue;">Sea lions seem to know when it is good to hunt together,</p> They usually do so when prey is abundant. They feed on more than 50 species of fishes and cephalopods, feeding primarily on squids, octopuses, hake, northern anchovy, opaleye, and herring.</p>
<h2><strong>Are they the Hunters or the Hunted?</strong></h2>
	<p>Although it may seem as if Sea Lions have it easy,<p style="color:red;"> They are preyed upon by orcas and sharks, as well as coyotes, feral dogs and bald eagles hunting for pups while on land.</p> Disease, parasites and the weather system El Nino also take their toll. They are also vulnerable to the effects of climate change on ocean currents, which impacts their fish prey abundance.</p>
